OptiTrack – Real-Time Field Operations Management
OptiTrack is a MERN-based web application developed during my Final Year Internship (PFE) at SOTETEL. The platform is designed to enhance field operations by enabling real-time tracking of technicians and vehicles, improving task planning, monitoring, and team coordination.

🔍 The tracking functionality is powered by the Traccar API, which allows precise, live location monitoring integrated into the platform.
